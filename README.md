# BCG Data-Science-Advanced-Analytics-Virtual-Experience

## Project Description
Background Information PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers. One of the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customersâ€™ price sensitivities and that it is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model.
