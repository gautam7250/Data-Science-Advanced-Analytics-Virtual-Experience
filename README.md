# BCG Data-Science-Advanced-Analytics-Virtual-Experience

## Project Description
Background Information PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small & Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers. One of the hypotheses under consideration is that churn is driven by the customers’ price sensitivities and that it is possible to predict customers likely to churn using a predictive model.


## Methods used
* <h2>Business Understanding & Problem Framing</h2>
 > To understand what is going on at the client and think about how you would approach a problem like this to test this specific hypothesis.

* <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning</h2>
> To address missing values, duplicates, data type conversions, transformations, and multicolinearity, as well as outliers. Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, and identify any missing data or null values, and how often they appear in the data. Visualize specific parameters as well as variable distributions.

* <h2>Feature Engineering</h2>
> Feature Engineering Think through what key drivers of churn could be for our client Build the features in order to get ready to model.

* <h2>Modeling & Evaluation</h2>
> Modeling & Evaluation Build churn model(s) to try to predict the churn probability of any customer, taking into account all the explanatory variables you have constructed in the feature engineering process. Evaluate your model, using a holdout set, and with metrics of your choosing. Be sure to pick a metric that would make sense for this business case. Interpret the results and use them to formulate your answers to the client’s hypotheses and questions. You will be asked to form these answers into coherent thoughts and recommendations in the next module.


* <h2>Insights & Recommendation</h2>
> Insights Develop an executive summary slide synthesizing all the findings from the project so far, keeping in mind that this will be for the steering committee meeting which the head of the SME division, as well as other various stakeholders, will be attending.
